Open source production pipeline.

## About
When we think about pipeline management we generally turn to big companies doing big things with big data however that doesn't mean we should limit our concepts of infrastructure to just the largest of us. This project is built on the belief that pipeline design and asset management doesn't have to be reserved for the heavy hitters.

### Philosophy
Modularity is a word thrown around a lot today but it can come in handy when thinking generally about the way we set up our pipeline(s). Nothing in this project should be hard handled (or coded) to massage only one school of thought. When it comes time to apply it to a real host the user should only then think about how it directly affects them.

If you're willing to work in this guideline then I wish you the best! Thank you for contributing and let's do this thing!
